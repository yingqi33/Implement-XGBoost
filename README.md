# implement-XGBoost

XGBoost is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible and portable. 
It implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework. 
XGBoost provides a parallel tree boosting (also known as GBDT, GBM) that solve many data science problems in a fast and accurate way. 
The same code runs on major distributed environment (Hadoop, SGE, MPI) and can solve problems beyond billions of examples.

Here I implement XGBoost from scratch so as to see how this algorithm draw samples, train classifiers and update results.
